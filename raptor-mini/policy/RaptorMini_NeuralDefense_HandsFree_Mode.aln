  # 1. USER EXPERIENCE GOALS
  # ======================
  goals:
    - "No coding required: everything configured via simple toggles and presets."
    - "Hands-free: once enabled, protection runs automatically in the background."
    - "Continuously evolving: the system learns from new patterns without manual tuning."
    - "Zero tolerance: no hypnotic or coercive voice/signals allowed through local networks or XR stacks."
