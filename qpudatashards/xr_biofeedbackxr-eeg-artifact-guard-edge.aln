math.proof
statement Given NPU=4.5 TOPS and model_ops=5e6 per 1s window, raw compute budget << 1 ms; with overhead, keeping artifact removal <10 ms satisfies XR biofeedback loops targeting <100 ms end-to-end latency.
explanation Divide model operations by NPU capacity to bound theoretical execution time, then budget remaining time for data movement and scheduling, ensuring responsiveness for closed-loop XR interactions.

scientific.grounding
fact Edge deployments of deep autoencoder EEG artifact removal have been demonstrated on embedded systems, confirming feasibility of on-device denoising for wearable EEG, with power consumption as the primary design constraint.
source EEG artifact removal at the edge using AI hardware; state-of-the-art and deep-learning reviews.

legal-terms
text Wearable XR biofeedback platforms must process EEG data on-device wherever possible, employ validated artifact-removal algorithms that preserve clinically relevant features, and document model behavior, training data, and limitations in accordance with neurofeedback practice guidelines, medical-device norms, and cybersecurity frameworks, including explicit informed consent for neural data processing and 30-day tamper-evident logging of safety-critical decisions.
